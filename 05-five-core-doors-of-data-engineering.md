# 🌱 Learning Data Engineering as a Journey  
## Five Main Doors Every Data Engineer Walks Through

---

1️⃣ Data Ingestion – how data actually enters GCS (real-world ways)  
2️⃣ Dataflow deeper – batch vs streaming (still calm, no code)  
3️⃣ BigQuery deeper – datasets, tables, partitions (concept level)  
4️⃣ SQL for Data Engineers – only what you really need  
5️⃣ Quick recap + confidence check, then continue

## A Calm Beginning

Learning data engineering is not about rushing or memorizing tools.  
It is a journey — a calm walk where we move forward step by step, picking milestones on the way.

Each milestone opens a new door.  
Behind every door there are deep details, tools, and practices.  
But first, we only need to recognize **the doors**.

A good data engineer is not someone who knows everything.  
A good data engineer is someone who knows **where they are in the journey**.

## The Core Foundation

At the heart of Google Data Engineering lies a simple and powerful flow:

GCS → Dataflow → BigQuery

This flow explains how data moves:
- from storage
- through processing
- into understanding

This is supported by the natural data movement called ETL.

ETL means:
Extract → Transform → Load

Extract data from GCS,  
transform it through Dataflow,  
and load it into BigQuery.

Everything else in data engineering exists to support this flow.

## The Five Main Doors of Data Engineering

These five doors represent the complete data engineering journey.  
Every good data engineer must walk through all of them.

---

### 🚪 Door 1: Data Ingestion

This door answers one simple question:

How does data enter the system?

Here we learn:
- where data comes from
- how it arrives
- how it is safely placed into storage (GCS)

If data does not enter correctly, nothing else matters.

---

### 🚪 Door 2: Data Processing (Batch and Streaming)

This door focuses on movement and change.

Here we learn:
- how data is cleaned
- how data is transformed
- how batch and streaming differ
- how Dataflow does the heavy lifting

This is where engineering thinking grows.

---

### 🚪 Door 3: Data Storage and Modeling

This door teaches us how to organize data for understanding.

Here we learn:
- how BigQuery is structured
- projects, datasets, and tables
- how data should be stored for performance and clarity

Good storage design makes analytics easy and fast.

---

### 🚪 Door 4: Querying and Validation

This door is about trust.

Here we learn:
- how to ask questions using SQL
- how to validate data
- how to ensure correctness
- how to catch problems early

Wrong data is worse than no data.

---

### 🚪 Door 5: Confidence and Ownership

This final door is not technical.

Here we learn:
- the full end-to-end flow
- why data exists
- who uses it
- and why our responsibility matters

This door turns a learner into a professional.

---

## A Very Important Insight

Each door contains deep knowledge, tools, and complexity.  
But no one masters everything at once.

The goal is not to rush.  
The goal is to walk the journey with clarity.

When you know the doors,  
new tools will never scare you.

---

## The One-Line Framework

Data Engineering can always be explained as:

Ingest → Process → Store → Query → Take Ownership

If you remember this, you are never lost.

---

## Final Calm Reminder

We are not running.  
We are walking.

We are learning data engineering in an interesting, human, and confident way —  
one milestone at a time.

This journey is enough to become a good data engineer.
