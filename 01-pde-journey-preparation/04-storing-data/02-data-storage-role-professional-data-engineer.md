# Role of a Professional Data Engineer in Storing Data

## Introduction
**Mr. X:** Module 3 sounds important. What exactly is my role when it comes to storing data for Cymbal Retail on Google Cloud?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** This is a very important module. As a Professional Data Engineer, you are responsible for **how data is designed, stored, governed, and maintained** so that the business can use it efficiently, securely, and legally.

## Understanding Cymbal Retail’s Data Landscape
**Mr. X:** What kind of data does Cymbal Retail actually deal with?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Cymbal Retail handles **many types of data**, such as:
- Documents  
- Images  
- Text  
- Videos  

This data is ingested, stored, processed, and analyzed across the organization. In fact, there are **close to a thousand databases**, containing both:
- Structured data  
- Unstructured data  

Managing this variety is a major responsibility.

## Choosing the Right Storage and Databases
**Mr. X:** Google Cloud has so many storage and database options. How do I choose?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** That’s where your expertise matters. Google Cloud offers:
- SQL databases  
- NoSQL databases  
- Data lake solutions  
- Data warehouses  
- Data mesh products  

You must understand the **differences between these options** and choose the right one based on:
- Access patterns  
- Performance needs  
- Cost efficiency  

Making the wrong choice can increase cost or slow down analytics.

## Designing for Scale, Cost, and Performance
**Mr. X:** Cymbal Retail’s data sounds huge. How do we manage it at scale?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** The data runs into **petabytes**, so storage must support:
- Cost-efficient long-term storage  
- Fast data retrieval for analytics  
- Secure and controlled access  

Your data architecture must balance all three—cost, speed, and security.

## Governance and Compliance Responsibilities
**Mr. X:** What about laws and regulations?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** This is critical. Cymbal Retail operates in multiple regions, each with its own:
- Data privacy laws  
- Industry regulations  

You must ensure **clear and demonstrable governance controls**, so auditors can verify compliance.

## Managing the Data Lifecycle
**Mr. X:** What does “data lifecycle” mean in practice?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** It means data must follow a clear journey:
- When it is created  
- How long it is retained  
- When and how it is deleted  

Each region defines **strict retention and deletion timelines** for customer data.  
Your job is to:
- Set technical controls  
- Prevent accidental violations by users  

## Maintaining and Evolving the Data Architecture
**Mr. X:** Is the job finished once everything is stored correctly?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Not at all. A Professional Data Engineer must:
- Maintain data so it stays useful  
- Update storage and architecture as business needs change  

As requirements evolve, your data architecture must evolve too.

## Business Alignment: The Mark of a Great Data Engineer
**Mr. X:** What really makes someone an excellent data engineer?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Beyond tools and technology, it’s the ability to:
- Understand business goals  
- Translate those goals into smart data decisions  

When data storage choices directly support business outcomes, you’re doing the job right.
