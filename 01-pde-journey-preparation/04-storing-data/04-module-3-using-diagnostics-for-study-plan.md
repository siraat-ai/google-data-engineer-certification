# Using Diagnostic Questions to Refine Your Study Plan (Module 3)

## Why This Review Is Important
**Mr. X:** I’ve completed the diagnostic questions for Module 3. How do they actually help me prepare for the exam?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Good question. These diagnostic questions are **not a full exam guide**. Their purpose is to help you understand **what to study more deeply**, not to teach everything outright.

## Reminder About Course and Diagnostics
**Mr. X:** So I shouldn’t rely only on this course and these questions?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Exactly. Keep these points in mind:
- This course **does not cover the entire exam syllabus**
- Diagnostic questions **do not include every possible exam scenario**

Instead, they help you:
- Understand the **scope** of this exam section  
- Identify the **types of storage-related skills** expected of a Professional Data Engineer  

## Reviewing by Exam Objectives
**Mr. X:** What’s the right way to review my answers now?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Use an objective-driven approach:
1. Look at one **exam section objective** related to data storage
2. Review the **diagnostic questions** connected to that objective
3. Reflect on how confident you felt answering them

This tells you whether that objective is:
- A strength  
- Or an area that needs more study  

## Connecting Questions to Learning Resources
**Mr. X:** Once I know my weak areas, what should I do next?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** For each objective:
- Briefly revisit the **correct answers**
- Then find **where to learn more**, such as:
  - Official Google Cloud documentation  
  - Courses in the learning path  
  - Relevant skill badges  

These resources help you deepen your understanding beyond the questions.

## Using the Workbook to Build Your Plan
**Mr. X:** How should I use my workbook during this process?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Think of your workbook as your **study tracker**. As you go through each objective:
- Mark the documentation you need to read carefully
- Highlight courses you should revisit
- Note skill badges you want to practice

Spend extra time on topics where:
- You hesitated  
- You guessed the answer  
- You didn’t fully understand *why* the answer was correct  

## Final Guidance
**Mr. X:** Any final advice before I move on?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Yes:
- Don’t try to study everything equally  
- Let diagnostic questions **guide your priorities**  
- Combine objectives, questions, and resources into one focused plan  

That’s how you prepare **strategically and efficiently** for the Professional Data Engineer certification.
