# Using Diagnostic Questions to Build Your Study Plan

## Introduction
**Mr. X:** I answered the diagnostic questions, but I’m still not sure how they help me study for the exam.  
**Mr. Artificial King:** That’s a very common feeling. These questions are not just for testing you—they are tools to help you *plan* your preparation smartly.

## Purpose of the Diagnostic Questions
**Mr. X:** So, are these questions enough to pass the exam?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** No, and that’s an important reminder.  
- This course is **not designed to teach everything** needed for the exam  
- The diagnostic questions **do not cover all exam topics**

Their real purpose is to help you understand:
- The **scope** of this exam section  
- The **types of skills** you are expected to develop  

## How to Use the Questions Effectively
**Mr. X:** Then how should I use them properly?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** You should use them as a mirror. They show:
- What you already understand well  
- Where you feel confused or unsure  

This helps you decide **what to focus on more** while studying.

## Reviewing Section Objectives
**Mr. X:** What’s the right way to review after answering them?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Follow this structured approach:
1. Look at one **exam section objective**
2. Review the **questions related to that objective**
3. Check which answers felt easy and which felt difficult

This tells you how strong you are in that area.

## Connecting Questions to Learning Resources
**Mr. X:** Once I know my weak areas, what’s next?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** For each objective:
- Briefly review the correct answers
- Then identify **where to learn more**, such as:
  - Official Google documentation  
  - Courses in the learning path  
  - Skill badges related to that topic  

These resources help you close the gaps.

## Building a Personal Study Plan
**Mr. X:** How do I turn all this into a study plan?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Use your workbook as a guide:
- Mark the documentation you need to read carefully
- Highlight courses you should revisit
- Note skill badges you should practice

Focus more time on areas where:
- You guessed answers
- You eliminated options but weren’t confident
- You didn’t fully understand *why* an answer was correct

## Final Advice
**Mr. X:** Any last tips before I start planning?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Yes:
- Don’t try to study everything equally  
- Let the diagnostic questions guide your priorities  
- Use objectives + questions + resources together  

That’s how you create a **targeted and effective study plan**, not a random one.
