# Using Diagnostic Questions to Shape Your Study Plan (Module 2)

## Why This Review Matters
**Mr. X:** I finished the diagnostic questions, but I’m not sure how they help me plan my studies.  
**Mr. Artificial King:** That’s exactly why this review exists. These diagnostic questions are **not** meant to teach you everything or predict your exam score. They are meant to **guide your preparation**.

## Important Reminder About the Course
**Mr. X:** So if I master these questions, am I fully ready for the exam?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Not quite. Keep these points in mind:
- This course does **not** cover everything on the exam  
- Diagnostic questions also **don’t include all possible exam topics**

Instead, they help you understand:
- The **scope** of this exam section  
- The **types of skills** you are expected to build  

## How to Review Using Exam Objectives
**Mr. X:** Then how should I review properly?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Use a structured approach:
1. Look at one **exam section objective**
2. Review the **diagnostic questions** related to that objective
3. Check how confident you felt answering them

This tells you whether an objective is a **strength or a gap**.

## Connecting Answers to Learning Resources
**Mr. X:** What should I do after spotting my weak areas?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** For each objective:
- Briefly review the **correct answers**
- Then identify **where to learn more**, such as:
  - Official Google documentation  
  - Courses in the learning path  
  - Relevant skill badges  

These resources are where you deepen your understanding.

## Using Your Workbook Effectively
**Mr. X:** How does the workbook fit into all this?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Your workbook is your **personal study planner**. As you go through each objective:
- Mark the documentation you need to read carefully
- Highlight courses you should revisit
- Note skill badges you want to complete

Focus extra effort on topics where:
- You were unsure
- You guessed the answer
- You didn’t fully understand *why* an answer was correct

## Final Guidance
**Mr. X:** Any final advice before I start studying?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Yes:
- Don’t study everything equally  
- Let diagnostic questions **set your priorities**  
- Use objectives, questions, and resources together  

That’s how you build a **focused, efficient, and realistic study plan** for the certification.
