# Using Diagnostic Questions to Build Your Study Plan (Module 5)

## Why This Review Matters
**Mr. X:** I’ve finished the diagnostic questions for Module 5. How should I use them to plan my study?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** These questions are not meant to test everything or guarantee exam readiness. Their real purpose is to help you **focus your preparation**.

## Important Reminder
**Mr. X:** So I shouldn’t depend only on this course?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Exactly. Remember:
- This course does **not teach everything** required for the exam  
- Diagnostic questions **don’t cover all possible exam topics**

Instead, they help you understand:
- The **scope** of this section  
- The **skills** you need to develop around maintenance and automation  

## Reviewing by Exam Objectives
**Mr. X:** What’s the best way to review now?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Take an objective-based approach:
1. Look at each **exam objective** related to maintaining and automating data workloads
2. Review the **diagnostic questions** tied to that objective
3. Note which questions felt easy and which felt challenging

This shows where your strengths and gaps are.

## Linking Questions to Learning Resources
**Mr. X:** Once I find my weak areas, what should I do next?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** For each objective:
- Briefly review the **correct answers**
- Identify **where to learn more**, such as:
  - Official Google Cloud documentation  
  - Relevant courses  
  - Skill Badges related to monitoring, automation, and reliability  

These resources help you build deeper understanding.

## Using the Workbook to Plan Your Studies
**Mr. X:** How does the workbook help here?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Use your workbook as a **study tracker**. As you go through objectives:
- Mark documentation you want to read carefully
- Highlight courses you want to revisit
- Note Skill Badges you want to complete

Spend more time on topics where:
- You hesitated  
- You guessed  
- You didn’t fully understand *why* an answer was correct  

## Final Advice
**Mr. X:** Any final tips before I move on?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Yes:
- Don’t study everything equally  
- Let diagnostic questions **guide your priorities**  
- Combine objectives, questions, and resources into a focused plan  

That’s how you prepare **efficiently and confidently** for the Professional Data Engineer certification.
