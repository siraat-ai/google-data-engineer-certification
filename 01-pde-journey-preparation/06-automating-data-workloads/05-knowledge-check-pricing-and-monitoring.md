# Knowledge Check: Maintaining and Automating Data Workloads

## Choosing a Cost-Effective BigQuery Pricing Model
**Mr. X:** Our company just migrated to Google Cloud and started using BigQuery. We don’t know how much querying we’ll do yet, but we want to control costs. What pricing model should we choose?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** When usage is unpredictable, flexibility is key. **BigQuery’s on-demand pricing** charges only for the data scanned by queries. There’s no upfront commitment, making it ideal for teams still learning their usage patterns.

**✔ Correct Answer:** Use BigQuery’s on-demand pricing model.

## Monitoring Automated Data Workloads
**Mr. X:** Cymbal Retail has automated data processing workloads. We want built-in dashboards and alerts when something goes wrong. Which tool should we use?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** **Cloud Monitoring** is designed exactly for this. It provides:
- Out-of-the-box metrics  
- Prebuilt dashboards  
- Alerting based on thresholds and conditions  

This makes it easy to monitor reliability and respond quickly.

**✔ Correct Answer:** Cloud Monitoring

## Key Takeaways
**Mr. Artificial King:** Remember:
- Use **BigQuery on-demand pricing** when workload patterns are unknown  
- Use **Cloud Monitoring** for metrics, dashboards, and alerts  

These choices help you balance **cost efficiency, reliability, and operational visibility**—key goals for a Professional Data Engineer.
