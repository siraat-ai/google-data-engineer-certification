# Using Diagnostic Questions to Build Your Study Plan (Module 4)

## Why This Review Exists
**Mr. X:** I’ve completed the diagnostic questions for Module 4. How should I use them to plan my studies?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** This review helps you **study smarter**, not harder. The diagnostic questions are not meant to teach everything or fully test exam readiness.

## Important Reminder
**Mr. X:** So I shouldn’t rely only on these questions?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Exactly. Keep this in mind:
- This course does **not** cover the entire exam syllabus  
- Diagnostic questions **do not include every possible exam topic**

Their real purpose is to help you understand:
- The **scope** of this exam section  
- The **types of skills** you need to develop  

## Reviewing by Exam Objectives
**Mr. X:** What’s the best way to review now?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Use an objective-based approach:
1. Look at one **exam section objective**
2. Review the **questions related to that objective**
3. Reflect on how confident you felt answering them

This quickly shows which areas are strong and which need work.

## Linking Answers to Learning Resources
**Mr. X:** Once I find weak areas, what should I do?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** For each objective:
- Briefly review the **correct answers**
- Then identify **where to learn more**, such as:
  - Official Google Cloud documentation  
  - Relevant courses in the learning path  
  - Associated Skill Badges  

These resources help you deepen your understanding beyond the questions.

## Using the Workbook Effectively
**Mr. X:** How does the workbook help here?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Your workbook is your **study roadmap**. As you go through each objective:
- Mark the documentation you want to read carefully
- Highlight courses to revisit
- Note Skill Badges you want to complete

Spend extra time on topics where:
- You hesitated  
- You guessed the answer  
- You didn’t fully understand *why* an answer was correct  

## Final Advice
**Mr. X:** Any final tips before I move ahead?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Yes:
- Don’t try to study everything equally  
- Let diagnostic questions **guide your priorities**  
- Combine objectives, questions, and resources into one focused plan  

That’s how you prepare **efficiently and confidently** for the Professional Data Engineer certification.
