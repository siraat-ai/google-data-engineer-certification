## 🧭 Learning Source & Structure

### 📌 Official Learning Path Followed

All content in this repository is based on the official Google learning path:

🔗 **Google Cloud – Data Engineer Path**  
https://www.skills.google/paths/16

Each module, lecture, and video concept from this path is **studied, transformed, and explained** here.

---

## 🎭 Unique Learning Style (Important)

To make learning easier and more memorable, the concepts are presented through **guided conversations** involving two fictional characters:

- **🧑‍🎓 Mr. X – The Curious Learner**  
  Asks real beginner-level and exam-style questions.

- **🤖 Mr. Artificial King – The Kind Guider**  
  Calmly explains concepts, clears confusion, and connects ideas logically.

👉 These interactions are **AI-generated** and are used to:
- Break down complex topics  
- Simulate how doubts actually arise  
- Build conceptual clarity instead of rote learning
