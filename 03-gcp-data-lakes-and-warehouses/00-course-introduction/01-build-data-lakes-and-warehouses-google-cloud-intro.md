## 1. What Is This Course About?

**Mr. X:**
What is the main focus of the *Build Data Lakes and Data Warehouses on Google Cloud* course?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
This course introduces you to the **foundations of modern data platforms** on **Google Cloud**.

You start by understanding:

* **Data lakes**
* **Data warehouses**
* **Data lakehouses**

Then, you learn how Google Cloud brings these concepts together using modern, scalable services.

---

## 2. Understanding Data Lakes, Warehouses, and Lakehouses

**Mr. X:**
Why do we need all these different data architectures?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
Each architecture solves a different problem:

* **Data lakes**

  * Store large volumes of raw data
  * Flexible and cost-effective

* **Data warehouses**

  * Optimized for analytics and reporting
  * High performance and structured

* **Data lakehouses**

  * Combine the **flexibility of data lakes**
  * With the **performance and governance of warehouses**

This course focuses on how **lakehouses unify the best of both worlds**.

---

## 3. Core Google Cloud Building Blocks

**Mr. X:**
Which Google Cloud tools are used to build these systems?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
You’ll work with three core services:

* **Google Cloud Storage**

  * Acts as the foundation of the data lake
  * Stores raw and open-format data

* **Google BigQuery**

  * Serves as the **central analytics engine**
  * Handles large-scale SQL analytics

* **BigLake**

  * Bridges data lakes and warehouses
  * Enables unified access, security, and governance

Together, these services form the backbone of a **Google Cloud lakehouse**.
