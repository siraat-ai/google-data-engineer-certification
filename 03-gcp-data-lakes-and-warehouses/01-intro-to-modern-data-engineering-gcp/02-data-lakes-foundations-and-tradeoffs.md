## 1. The Two Classic Data Storage Approaches

**Mr. X:**
I keep hearing about data lakes and data warehouses. Why do organizations rely on both?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
For many years, organizations have depended on **two primary large-scale data storage approaches**:

* **Data lakes**
* **Data warehouses**

They serve **different purposes**, are optimized for **different workloads**, and handle **different types of data**.
To understand this clearly, let’s look at an example company: **Cymbal**, a large e-commerce business.

## 2. What Is a Data Lake?

**Mr. X:**
Let’s start with data lakes. What are they, really?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
Think of a **data lake** as a **vast reservoir**.
It stores **huge amounts of raw data in its native format**, without forcing structure upfront.

A data lake can store:

* **Structured data**
* **Semi-structured data**
* **Unstructured data**

You can pour almost *anything* into it.

---

## 3. Cymbal’s Data Lake Example

**Mr. X:**
What kind of data would Cymbal store in a data lake?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
For Cymbal, the data lake includes:

1. **Structured data**

   * Transaction tables from the sales database

2. **Semi-structured data**

   * JSON logs generated by web servers

3. **Unstructured data**

   * Customer-uploaded images
   * Product videos
   * Text reviews

All of this data lands in the lake **as-is**, without modification.

---

## 4. Schema-on-Read: A Core Data Lake Principle

**Mr. X:**
If the data is raw, how do we analyze it?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
That’s where **schema-on-read** comes in.

With data lakes:

* You **store everything first**
* You decide **how to structure it later**, when you read it

This philosophy is often described as:

> *“Store everything now, figure out how to use it later.”*

This approach gives maximum flexibility.

---

## 5. Why Data Lakes Are So Valuable

**Mr. X:**
Why do companies like Cymbal rely on data lakes so much?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
Data lakes are ideal for **exploration and innovation**.

For example:

* Cymbal’s data scientists need **raw clickstream data**
* They use it to train **machine learning models**
* This data feeds a new **recommendation engine**

Because nothing is filtered or transformed upfront, data scientists can explore freely.

## 6. Advantages of Data Lakes

**Mr. X:**
What are the main benefits of data lakes?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
Data lakes offer several strong advantages:

1. **Flexibility**

   * Can store *any* data type

2. **Agility**

   * Very fast data ingestion

3. **Scalability**

   * Can scale to **exabyte-level** data

4. **Cost-effectiveness**

   * Built on low-cost object storage

5. **Advanced analytics support**

   * Excellent for AI and ML workloads

---

## 7. Disadvantages of Data Lakes

**Mr. X:**
It sounds great—but what are the downsides?

**Mr. Artificial King:**
Data lakes come with real challenges:

1. **Risk of a “data swamp”**

   * Without governance, data becomes messy and unusable

2. **Management complexity**

   * Requires strong metadata, governance, and monitoring

3. **Time-consuming analysis**

   * Raw data often needs cleaning and preparation

4. **Security and compliance risks**

   * Raw data formats can expose sensitive information

These risks grow as the data lake scales.

---

## 8. Key Takeaway

**Mr. Artificial King:**
A **data lake** is powerful because it prioritizes **flexibility, scale, and raw access** to data.
However, without strong governance and structure, it can quickly become difficult to manage.

Understanding these strengths and weaknesses is essential before comparing data lakes with **data warehouses**—which we’ll explore next.
