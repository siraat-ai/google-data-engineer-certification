# Introduction to Data Engineering on Google Cloud

## Welcome to the Course
**Mr. X:** I just heard the introduction. What is this course really about?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Welcome! This course, *Introduction to Data Engineering on Google Cloud*, is designed to help you **start or strengthen your journey as a data engineer on Google Cloud**.

It doesn’t matter whether:
- You already work as a data engineer  
- Or you’re looking to grow into a data engineering role  

This course helps you build a solid foundation.

## Who Is This Course For?
**Mr. X:** Is this only for experienced data engineers?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** Not at all. This course is designed for:
- Data engineers  
- Anyone interested in **preparing, processing, and organizing data** for use in their organization  

If you want to understand how data is handled end to end on Google Cloud, this course is for you.

## How You’ll Learn
**Mr. X:** How is the learning structured?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** The course uses a mix of:
- Lectures  
- Quizzes  
- Hands-on labs  

This combination helps you not only understand concepts but also **practice using real Google Cloud tools**.

## Tools You’ll Work With
**Mr. X:** What tools will I actually learn?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** You’ll be introduced to several core Google Cloud data tools, including:
- Dataflow  
- Dataproc  
- Cloud Composer  
- BigQuery  
- Bigtable  
- Datastream  

These tools are commonly used to build, run, and automate data pipelines.

## What You’ll Learn as a Data Engineer
**Mr. X:** What skills will I gain by the end of the course?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** You’ll learn to:
- Understand the **duties and responsibilities** of a data engineer  
- Identify common **data engineering tasks** on Google Cloud  
- Recognize the **core components** used to perform those tasks  
- Create and deploy **different types of data pipelines**  
- Apply **automation techniques** to make data workflows reliable and efficient  

These are essential real-world data engineering skills.

## Course Structure: Six Modules
**Mr. X:** How is the course organized?  
**Mr. Artificial King:** The course is divided into **six modules**, each focused on specific learning objectives:

- First, you explore **data engineering tasks and components** on Google Cloud  
- Next, you learn about **data replication and migration**  
- Then, you study the three main data pipeline patterns:
  - Extract and Load (EL)  
  - Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT)  
  - Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL)  
- Finally, you examine **automation techniques** that are critical for data engineers  

## Final Perspective
**Mr. Artificial King:** By the end of this course, you’ll have:
- A clear understanding of how data engineering works on Google Cloud  
- Hands-on experience with key tools  
- A strong foundation to continue learning or prepare for advanced certifications  

This course is your **starting point into professional data engineering on Google Cloud**.
