### Building an Event-Driven System Without Tight Coupling

**Mr. X the Curious Learner:**
“I’m designing a system where many services need to react to events, but I don’t want them tightly connected to each other. I want a **unified, event-driven architecture** that keeps services loosely coupled and scalable. Which Google Cloud service helps me do this?”

**Mr. Artificial King, the Calm Guider:**
“To create a unified, event-driven architecture for loosely coupled services, **Eventarc** is the right service. It connects events to services in a clean and scalable way.”

### Running Tasks Automatically on a Fixed Schedule

**Mr. X the Curious Learner:**
“I have jobs that must run automatically—every hour, every day, or every week—without manual triggers. I need a service that can **invoke workloads at recurring, scheduled intervals**. What should I use?”

**Mr. Artificial King, the Calm Guider:**
“For automating tasks on a schedule, **Cloud Scheduler** is the correct choice. It triggers your workloads reliably at defined intervals.”

### Reacting to Cloud Events With Code

**Mr. X the Curious Learner:**
“When something happens in Google Cloud—like a file upload or a message arrival—I want to **run code instantly in response** to that event. Which service lets me do this?”

**Mr. Artificial King, the Calm Guider:**
“That capability is provided by **Cloud Run functions**, which execute code automatically in response to Google Cloud events.”

### Orchestrating Complex Pipelines Across Systems

**Mr. X the Curious Learner:**
“I’m working with complex pipelines that span multiple systems and services, and I need one place to **orchestrate, monitor, and manage** all of them together. Which Google Cloud service acts as this central orchestrator?”

**Mr. Artificial King, the Calm Guider:**
“**Cloud Composer** fills that role perfectly. It acts as a central orchestrator, seamlessly integrating pipelines across diverse systems.”

### Understanding the Core Building Block of Cloud Composer

**Mr. X the Curious Learner:**
“In Cloud Composer, everything seems to revolve around something called a DAG. I want to clearly understand what it means. What exactly is a DAG in this context?”

**Mr. Artificial King, the Calm Guider:**
“In Cloud Composer, a DAG is a **Directed Acyclic Graph**, which defines the order and dependencies of tasks in a workflow.”
