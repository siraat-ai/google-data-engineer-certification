## 🎯 Lab Objective Overview

**Mr. X:** What is the main goal of this lab?
**Mr. Artificial King:** The goal is very practical. In this lab, you **learn how to load data into BigQuery** using different methods.

You will:

* Load data into **BigQuery**
* Use both:

  * Command-line tools
  * Google Cloud Console
* Work with multiple datasets
* Use **DDL (Data Definition Language)**

---

## 📥 Loading Data into BigQuery

**Mr. X:** Why is loading data so important?
**Mr. Artificial King:** Because analytics can only happen **after data is inside BigQuery**. Loading data is the **first hands-on step** in most data engineering workflows.

---

## 🖥️ Method 1: Command-Line Interface (CLI)

**Mr. X:** What does loading data from the command line mean?
**Mr. Artificial King:** It means using terminal commands (like the `bq` tool) to:

* Create datasets
* Create tables
* Load data files into BigQuery

📌 This method is useful for:

* Automation
* Scripts
* Repeatable pipelines

---

## 🌐 Method 2: Google Cloud Console

**Mr. X:** What if someone prefers a visual way?
**Mr. Artificial King:** Then the **Google Cloud Console** is perfect.

Using the console, you can:

* Upload files through the browser
* Select schema options
* Load data step by step visually

📌 This is great for:

* Beginners
* Quick testing
* Small datasets

---

## 🧩 Working with Multiple Datasets

**Mr. X:** Do we only load one dataset?
**Mr. Artificial King:** No. In this lab, you load **several datasets**.

This helps you understand:

* How datasets organize tables
* How projects, datasets, and tables relate to each other
* How BigQuery manages data at scale

---

## 🏗️ Using DDL (Data Definition Language)

**Mr. X:** What is DDL?
**Mr. Artificial King:** DDL stands for **Data Definition Language**.

It is used to:

* Create tables
* Define schemas
* Manage table structures using SQL

📌 Examples include commands like:

* `CREATE TABLE`
* `DROP TABLE`
* `ALTER TABLE`

This lets you manage BigQuery objects **purely with SQL**.

---

## ✅ Final Takeaway

**Mr. Artificial King:**

* This lab focuses on **loading data into BigQuery**
* You practice using:

  * Command-line interface
  * Google Cloud Console
* You work with **multiple datasets**
* You learn how to use **DDL** to define and manage tables

👉 These skills are **foundational for every data engineer**.
