## 📚 Key Reference Links for Google Dataflow (Official Docs)

The following resources are **essential reading** for understanding how Dataflow pipelines are designed, built, and reused in real-world production environments.

---

### 🧩 Dataflow Provided Templates

🔗 https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/templates/provided-templates

**What this helps with:**
- Understand ready-made Dataflow templates provided by Google
- Learn how to quickly deploy common batch and streaming pipelines
- Reduce development time by reusing proven patterns

💡 *Use this when you want speed, standardization, and fewer custom pipelines.*

---

### 🔄 Apache Beam – Applying Transforms

🔗 https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#applying-transforms

**What this explains:**
- Core Apache Beam programming model
- How transforms (Map, ParDo, GroupByKey, CoGroupByKey, etc.) work
- How data flows through a pipeline step by step

💡 *This is the conceptual backbone of Dataflow. Read slowly and revisit often.*

---

### 🏗️ Dataflow Job Builder

🔗 https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/job-builder

**What this covers:**
- Creating Dataflow jobs using the Job Builder UI
- Building pipelines without writing full code
- Faster prototyping and experimentation

💡 *Helpful for understanding pipeline structure and rapid job creation.*

---

### 📦 Dataflow Templates – Core Concepts

🔗 https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/concepts/dataflow-templates

**What you’ll learn:**
- Difference between classic templates and Flex templates
- When and why to use templates in production
- How templates support reusability, automation, and CI/CD

💡 *Critical for production-grade, repeatable Dataflow deployments.*

## ✅ How to Use These Links

1. Start with **Apache Beam transforms** to understand the core model  
2. Read **Dataflow templates concepts**  
3. Explore **provided templates** for practical examples  
4. Use **Job Builder** for visualization and quick experimentation  

These resources together form a **strong foundation for Dataflow-based batch and streaming pipelines**.
