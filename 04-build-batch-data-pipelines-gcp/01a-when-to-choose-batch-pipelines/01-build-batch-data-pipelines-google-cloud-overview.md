## 🧠 Course Introduction

**Mr. X the Curious Learner:**
“I already understand data warehouses and lakehouses. What’s the next step if I want to handle **large-scale batch data processing** on Google Cloud?”

**Mr. Artificial King, the Calm Guider:**
“This course is the perfect next step. **Build Batch Data Pipelines on Google Cloud** focuses on designing, building, and optimizing **robust, production-grade batch pipelines** that power business intelligence, reporting, and analytics at scale.”

---

## 🎯 What This Course Is About

This is an **intermediate-level course** designed to move you beyond basic ETL concepts and into **real-world pipeline engineering**.

### Core Focus Areas

* Large-scale batch data transformations
* Reliable and repeatable data workflows
* Performance and cost optimization
* Operational excellence (monitoring, alerts, data quality)

📌 These skills are critical for **timely reporting and decision-making** in modern data platforms.

---

## 🛠️ Key Google Cloud Services You’ll Use

### 🌊 Dataflow (Apache Beam)

**Mr. X:**
“I’ve heard Dataflow is powerful but complex. Why is it important?”

**Mr. Artificial King:**
“Because **Dataflow** lets you build **fully managed batch pipelines** using the Apache Beam model.”

#### What You’ll Learn

* Design batch pipelines with Apache Beam
* Handle large-scale transformations
* Let Google manage scaling, retries, and infrastructure

📌 Write the pipeline logic — Google handles the rest.

---

### ⚡ Dataproc Serverless (Apache Spark)

**Mr. X:**
“What if I already know Spark?”

**Mr. Artificial King:**
“Then you’ll love **Dataproc Serverless**.”

#### What You’ll Learn

* Run Spark batch jobs **without managing clusters**
* Use Python or Spark SQL
* Scale jobs automatically and pay only for execution time

📌 Spark power, without Spark operations.

---

## 🔄 From ETL Basics to Production Pipelines

**Mr. Artificial King:**
“This course goes beyond ‘just moving data’.”

### You’ll Explore

* Complex batch transformations
* Workflow orchestration patterns
* Dependency handling between jobs
* Designing pipelines for reliability and re-runs

📊 These are the pipelines that feed **executive dashboards and regulatory reports**.

---

## ✅ Data Quality, Monitoring & Alerting

**Mr. X:**
“What happens when pipelines fail silently?”

**Mr. Artificial King:**
“That’s unacceptable in production.”

### Operational Excellence Topics

* Data validation and quality checks
* Monitoring pipeline health
* Alerting on failures or delays
* Detecting schema drift and bad data early

📌 Reliable pipelines build **trust in analytics**.

---

## 📚 Recommended Background Knowledge

This course assumes you already have:

* Basic data warehousing and ETL/ELT knowledge
* Familiarity with:

  * SQL
  * Python
* General understanding of Google Cloud concepts

🎓 It’s ideal if you’ve already studied lakehouses, BigQuery, or data engineering fundamentals.

---

## 🌟 Why This Course Matters

**Mr. Artificial King:**
“Batch pipelines are the backbone of analytics.”

By completing this course, you’ll be able to:

* Design scalable batch pipelines
* Choose the right processing engine (Dataflow vs Spark)
* Build pipelines that are **efficient, reliable, and production-ready**
* Support critical BI and reporting workloads

> **Good analytics start with great pipelines.**

---

## 🧠 One-Line Takeaway

> **This course equips you to design, build, and operate scalable batch data pipelines on Google Cloud using Dataflow and Dataproc Serverless, with a strong focus on reliability and performance.**
